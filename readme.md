# Telemetry Resender
## Description
This code component is designed to act as a mediator between two Dapr endpoints. It retrieves data from a source Dapr endpoint, processes it (if required), and then resends it to a destination Dapr endpoint. This component can be useful in scenarios where data needs to be transferred from one microservice to another, or where data needs to be transformed before being sent to its final destination. The component uses the Dapr API to communicate with the source and destination endpoints, ensuring seamless and efficient data transfer between them.
